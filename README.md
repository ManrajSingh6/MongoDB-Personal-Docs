# MongoDB-Personal-Docs
I'm currently learning MongoDB and NoSQL databases. 
I have created two files (app.js) and (mongoose-app.js) as a form of personal documentation for future projects.
The documentation is for when MongoDB is being used with NodeJS.
Using Mongoose appears to be much simpler and less wordy in comparison to using the MongoDB connector.
